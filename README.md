# ans-apache2-mint
Ansible playbooks for managing apache2 on Mint OS. Using this as a personal learning exercise, so... yeah.
To use these, I had to anable the root user, modify ssh settings, add ssh keys, copy ssh keys, and generally a lot of thing sfrowned on by Mint OS and linux users in general.
The end result works for what I was trying to do- use Anisble to install and setup apache (actually Apache2, and I wanted to use httpd instead but... Mint) using Ansible roles.
